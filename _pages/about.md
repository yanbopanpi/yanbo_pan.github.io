Greetings, I'm Yanbo Pan, an astrophysics and statistics undergraduate currently studying at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor. My journey so far has led me to explore the universe and develop a strong foundation in scientific thinking. 🌌⭐🪐

## Research Interests:
- Local group ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies search and characterization
- Alternative evolution pathways for binary stars by orbit modeling
- Hot Jupiter atmospheric characterization and retrieval
- Bayesian statistics applications on Astrophysics

## Personal:
![running pics](https://yanbopanpi.github.io/yanbo_pan.github.io//images/marathon.jpg){: .align-right width="320px"}
I am from [Ningbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo), a "small" coastal city in the southeastern part of China. I first went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison 🦡, and I spent my first year of college on the beautiful lakeshore of [Lake Mendota](https://lakeshorepreserve.wisc.edu/visit/places/lake-mendota/). Apparently, I *liked* the weather so much that I transferred to the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor ☃️ to finish my undergraduate studies.

Outside my research life, I enjoy distance running🏃‍♂️, playing table tennis🏓, and kayaking on the Huron River🚣‍♂️. If the weather is good, I will run through [the Arb](https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum/) after all my classes. I also enjoy going to the [State Theatre](https://michtheater.org/) and enjoying movies and shows with friends.
