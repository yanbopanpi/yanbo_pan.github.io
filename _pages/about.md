Hi, I'm Yanbo Pan, an astrophysics and statistics enthusiast currently studying at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor. My journey so far has led me to explore the Cosmos and develop a strong foundation in data analysis and scientific thinking. ‚≠êüååü™ê

## Research Interests:
- Cosmological archeology by searching for ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies near M31
- Alternative evolution pathways for binary stars by orbit modeling
- Hot Jupiter atmospheric retrieval


## Personal Life:
![running pics](images/marathon.jpg){: .align-right width="350px"}
Outside my research life, I enjoy distance running and playing table tennis. If the weather is good, which is kind of rare in Michigan, I will run through [the Arb](https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum/) after I finish my class. I also enjoy going to the [State Theatre](https://michtheater.org/) and enjoying movies and shows with friends.
