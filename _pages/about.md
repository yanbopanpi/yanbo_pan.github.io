Greetings, I'm Yanbo Pan, an astrophysics and statistics enthusiast currently studying at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor. My journey so far has led me to explore the universe and develop a strong foundation in scientific thinking. üåå‚≠êü™ê

## Research Interests:
- Cosmological archeology by searching for ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies
- Alternative evolution pathways for binary stars by orbit modeling
- Hot Jupiter atmospheric retrieval

## Personal:
![running pics](https://yanbopanpi.github.io/yanbo_pan.github.io//images/marathon.jpg){: .align-right width="320px"}
I am from [Ningbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo), a small coastal city in China. I first went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison ü¶°, and I spent my first year of college on the lakeshore of [Lake Mendota](https://lakeshorepreserve.wisc.edu/visit/places/lake-mendota/). Apparently, I *liked* the weather so much that I transferred to the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor ‚òÉÔ∏è to finish my undergraduate studies.\\
Outside my research life, I enjoy distance running and playing table tennis. If the weather is good, which is rare in Michigan, I will run through [the Arb](https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum/) after I finish all my classes. I also enjoy going to the [State Theatre](https://michtheater.org/) and enjoying movies and shows with friends.
