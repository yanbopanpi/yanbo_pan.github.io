# Science is never done alone.

I want to take this opportunity to thank all my teachers, advisors, and mentors (official and unofficial) for guiding me to find my own path in scientific research. None of these would be possible without people supported me along the way. Science is fun, but doing science together is better.

I am also deeply thankful to my family, who have always supported me throughout my life. 

To my friends and peers, thank you for preventing me from becoming a nerd.
