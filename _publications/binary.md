We utilized a custom Monte Carlo (theJoker) sampler, initially created for APOGEE’s sparsely and noisily measured radial velocities, in our examination of the WIYN Open Cluster Survey (WOCS). After utilizing rejection and MCMC sampling, we scrutinized single-lined binary orbits in M67 and NGC 188. Our objective was to evaluate theJoker’s efficacy on binaries with ample radial velocity data (RVD) and investigate the possibility of devising observing plans that would enable us to estimate binary orbital solutions with fewer RVD and better understand the alternative evolutionary tracks for binary stars. 
Through this research experience, I learned useful statistical methods, like rejection and MCMC sampling. Exposed to time-series data for the first time, I designed a custom pipeline that allows statistical comparison between our results and previous scientific results done by [Aaron M. Geller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07883). I also become more familiar with using cloud computing and virtual machines. 
For our future work, we will fit more binary solutions for WD-MS binaries, while improving the pipeline to better suit observation plans and reduce bias our priors might introduce.
