Abstract: By analyzing the stellar spatial distribution, we try to search for potential dwarf satellite galaxies by examining stellar overdensities within the DELVE survey. We attempt to search for overdensities for horizontal branch stars and red giant branch stars using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). We have focused on the Pegasus IV dwarf galaxy and its stellar population properties as a guide for our overdensity search. With the detected overdensities on the color-magnitude diagram, we also explore the stellar overdensities regarding their spatial distribution.
